To Dos
Get all the countries showing up with no dropdown
Setup your Main component with countries state
Get the supabase call working - don't worry about displaying - validate with console.log
Create your CountryCard component with hard coded data <CountryCard name="Scotland" continent="Europe" iso3="BES" />
Map through your countries state and display all the countries
Build the dropdown (don't worry about filtering at this point) -- make sure that when you change the dropdown, the state in Main.js gets updated -- use React dev tools to validate this step

Instead of displaying the countries -- display the FILTERED COUNTRIES

Add your loading state
